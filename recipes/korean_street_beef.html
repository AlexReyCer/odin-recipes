        <p>Crispy, grilled, buttery bread joins a slightly sweet, super savory vegetable-egg patty, smoky ham and melty cheese, and a ridiculous amount of mayo and ketchup for one of the most memorable sandwich experiences of my life. Plus, you'll eat about a whole serving of vegetables and barely even notice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup julienned carrot</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 stalk green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 thick slices white bread</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 thin slices smoked ham</li>
            <li>1 slice mild Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 1 Combine carrot, cabbage, green onion, black pepper, cayenne, and salt. Mix with your hands for about 30 seconds until soft and seasoned. Add eggs and mix thoroughly with a fork; set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 2 Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add bread slices and toss to make sure both sides are well buttered. Grill bread until both sides are beautifully toasted and golden brown and starting to get a little crispy. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 3 Heat remaining butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add cabbage mixture; cook and simultaneously mix by using the edge of a spatula to chop down on the surface while pushing the edges up and over the top. As the mixture starts to hold its shape, form into a rectangle that's about twice as long as it is wide. Split the rectangle in half and continue to cook until golden brown; flip and continue on the opposite side, 3 to 4 minutes total.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 4 Stack cabbage pieces on top of one another and transfer to toast. Top with sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 5 Add ham to the same skillet over medium heat; cook until sizzling. Flip and top ham with Cheddar cheese. Cook until melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong> 6 Place ham on sandwich and squeeze over mayonnaise and ketchup. Top with remaining slice of toast, slice in half, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
